# Business Plan: a Dual-Structure Model
 The dual-structure model (LLC + Nonprofit) is a smart, flexible solution for mission-driven businesses that want to:
- Operate a for-profit business (e.g., testing, consulting, product evaluation)
- Access grants, donations, and foundation funding through a nonprofit arm
- Keep clear financial and legal boundaries between mission work and revenue-driven services

 What Is a Dual-Structure Model?
- A dual-structure involves:
- A for-profit entity (e.g., LLC, Benefit Corp) ‚Üí handles revenue-generating activities
- A nonprofit organization (501(c)(3)) ‚Üí handles mission-driven, public benefit activities

 They may:
- Share founders, staff, branding, or office space
- Contract services with each other
- Collaborate on joint projects
